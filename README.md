👋 Welcome — I'm Damiano (aka d4mx or d4m.ee8.sh)

I'm a cybersecurity learner focused on real-world exploitation, vulnerability research, and blue team fundamentals.Currently building strong foundations across both offensive and defensive security. My approach is hands-on: I’ve ranked in the top 4% of TryHackMe (among the first 50,000 users) and I'm actively training for Hack The Box certifications, with plans to pursue CySA+ soon after.

My learning path bridges offensive and defensive disciplines with a focus on practical, adversary-based scenarios.
I’ve worked across core areas like:
- Web application security, including OWASP Top 10, API exploitation, and WordPress attack surfaces.
- Privilege escalation on both Linux and Windows environments, using real-world misconfigurations and token abuse-
- Initial access techniques, from brute-force to misconfigured services and exposed assets-
- Post-exploitation and persistence, exploring tactics used in live environments (e.g., DLL hijacking, SAM hash extraction, Windows privileges like SeTakeOwnership).
- Exploit chaining, crafting realistic attack paths from foothold to full compromise.
- Blue team fundamentals, such as log analysis, SIEM (Splunk, ELK), incident triage, and threat detection.
- This hands-on experience allows me to understand both how attackers operate and how defenders can respond—building a mindset grounded in real-world tactics, not just checklists.

I value clarity, discipline, and continuous improvement. My goal is to turn practical skills into professional impact, one lab at a time.
I turn curiosity into actionable security insight — and share what I learn.
